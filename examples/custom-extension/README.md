## Stylus CSS extension

This extension uses and creates a very different AST using postcss, which is incompatible with
`cssvar` vscode extension.

To fully support this CSS extension, I will have to either provide in-built support for this
CSS extension or ignore it for now.
I am ignoring it for now.
