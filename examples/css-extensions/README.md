# Brief

In case you are not directly working CSS files and using CSS extensions like SASS, SCSS, LESS, POSTCSS
you can still use this extension.

CSS extensions can have some specific syntax that are not compatible with pure CSS specs, like
SASS interpolations, single line comments and more.

This extension will work fine without any customization unless you are using non-standard CSS syntax.

To support non-standard CSS syntax, this extension uses `cssvar.postcssSyntax`.
This example demonstrates the use of that setting.

Details can be read [here for Customization](../../customize-extension.md).
